        While I’ve been in the Netherlands on an exchange semester I would be lying if I’d say I haven’t gotten homesick. As many other do when moving abroad for the first time. 
      I moved with my family right before I went to the Netherlands. So now when I get homesick I don’t know what home to be sick about. I don’t feel like I live here in the Netherlands. But I have lived here for longer then what is now my home. That makes for a really good opportunity to explore homesickness. Both for me personally and in a broader context. <br><br> Down here is an interview with my mom where we talked about homesickness, moving and building a new home.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Have you ever gotten homesick?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Yes of course. I remember when I first moved abroad to study. It was really hard at first, but my friend moved with me and we were roommates. So that really helped me feel more like home.
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        After we moved, did you get homesick for our old home?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Yes a little bit. It's always hard to move. But I think the homesickness comes from not being with the people you love.
   <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        What has changed after we moved?
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        To be honest, not much. The biggest change is the new routines that comes with living in a new place. And also now that we live in the center I feel like I see our friends more often.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Was our old home a big part of your identity?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        In some ways. But not in any meaningful ways. Some people from that town really feel strongly about their ties to their home town. But me, not that much.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Has your identity changed after we moved?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        No not really. But now I feel like I meet more of my people and go to more events in the city. Sometimes I felt like that was missing from when we lived in our old home.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Have you gotten the feeling of being at home at our new house?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Yes absolutely. I love living here. But like I said, I think that the feeling of being at home is to be around the people you care about. But of course it took time to get used to living in a new place.
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        Was there a specific moment when you felt like you had a new home?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        I think it was when we had a proper dinner all together. A couple of days after we moved in. It was just so peaceful after all of the moving.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        What do you miss about our old home?
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        I really liked how peacful and quiet it was. And also just the familiarity, we lived there for such a long time. But I'm happy we moved. I think we will really make a good home here at our new place.
